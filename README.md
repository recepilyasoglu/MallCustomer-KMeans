# MallCustomer-KMeans
KMeans Clustering in MallCustomer Dataset

## Problem: The market wants to segment its customers into segments (clusters).
Who knows, maybe it will deal with the customer in each segment separately and produce sales increase policies accordingly.

## Solution: KMeans Clustering
In this study, first the distribution of the columns in the data set, 
then the conversion of the Female/Male column to numeric variables, and finally the customer segmentation with KMeans Clustering are included.
